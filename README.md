<strong>Hello!</strong>
<br></br>
This repository serves as my personal portfolio. Included in this space are my resume, undergraduate work portfolio, and graduate work samples. 
These samples demonstrate software and technical capabilities as well as writing ability.
<br></br>
I am open to work! I am searching for a remote role that will allow me to use my current skillset and develop new abilities, too.
